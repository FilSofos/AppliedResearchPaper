Data and codes for the AppliedResearch (Wiley) paper: 
**A hybrid molecular dynamics/machine learning framework to calculate the viscosity and thermal conductivity of Ar, Kr, Xe, O and Œù**, 
by _Christos Stavrogiannis, Vasilis Tsioulos, Filippos Sofos_ (Condensed Matter Physics Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Thessaly, 35100 Lamia,GR).

Viscosity and thermal conductivity literature data is combined with newly-extracted MD simualtion data and a number of ML algorithms are trained. The MD/ML framework can be run in parallel.

The implied dataset from literature sources and MD simulations is given in excel sheets. A Jupyter Notebook for the ML algorithms is provided, along with a notebook with an example LAMMPS simulation.
