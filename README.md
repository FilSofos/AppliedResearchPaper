Data and codes for the AppliedResearch (Wiley) paper: 
A hybrid molecular dynamics/machine learning framework to calculate the viscosity and thermal conductivity of Ar, Kr, Xe, O and Œù, 
by Christos Stavrogiannis, Vasilis Tsioulos, Filippos Sofos (Condensed Matter Physics Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Thessaly, 35100 Lamia,GR).

Viscosity and thermal conductivity literature data is combined with newly-extracted MD simualtion data and a number of ML algorithms are trained. The MD/ML framework can be run in parallel.

The implied dataset from literature sources and MD simulations is given in excel sheets. A Jupyter Notebook for the ML algorithms is provided, along with a notebook with an example LAMMPS simulation.
